## The Problem

India has **47 million blue-collar workers** who need quality skill training. Existing solutions are either English-only, require expensive VR hardware costing ₹5L+, or provide passive video content with no real guidance.
| Solution | Cost | Language | AR | Offline |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Simbott | ₹5,00,000 headset | English | ✓ | ✗ |
| NSDC Portal | Free | English only | ✗ | ✗ |
| YouTube | Free | Mixed | ✗ | Partial |
| **KaushalAR** | **₹8,000 phone** | **Hindi + 11 langs** | **✓** | **✓** |

## Features

### AR Overlay Training
